from hw2 --> problems 6 and 7

  6.) Apply logistic regression to the dataset titled 'Problem 6'. Show your 'w' and classification error rate on both the training and testing set. How do you know if         your result is reasonable?
  
  7.) Repeat problem 6 using the dataset titled 'Problem 7'. Does logistic regression work well in this case and why?

from hw3 --> problems 2, 3, and 4

  2.) Use a neural network to redo Problem 6 of Homework 2. Compare your results with those from logistic regression, what are your conclusion?
  
  3.) Use a neural network to redo Problem 7 of Homework 2. Compare your results with those from logistic regression, what are your conclusions?
  
  4.) In this problem, we have provided a training and testing data set for a classification problem. Train a neural network on the training data and test it on the           testing data. For testing data, ground truth labels are not provided and you can submit your classification labels for evaluation by the TA. Record the neural           network you used, e.g., the number of hidden layers, activation functions, and optimization algorithm (providing only the name, e.g., momentum).
